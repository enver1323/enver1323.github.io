				<summary>Coding</summary>
				<p>
					I do enjoy coding. Coding is the best way to enhanceyour logic, comprehension and critical thinking. I started coding when I was at eighth grade. My first programming language was Pascal. My next language was C++. After all I started doing web-design. This summer I practised at small IT company.

					Basketball is my passion. I am not afraid to be hurt while playing, that is why I always play without any hesitation and fear. I started practising basketball when I enterred lyceum, but only several months ago I achieved some progress. This was the reason for me to love basketball even more.
